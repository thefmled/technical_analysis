# technical_analysis
This repository contains algorithms that predict the behavior of the stock market based on certain indicators.
Ranked Support and Resistances (.ipynb) takes n, check_tolerance, plot_tolerance as input from the user.
n = minimum strength of line drawn that decides what lines to keep and what to discard.
check_tolerance = zone around each turning point that is checked for more turning points. This contributes to the strength of that support or resistance line.
plot_tolerance = the zone the user wants highlighted around the support or the resistance line.
